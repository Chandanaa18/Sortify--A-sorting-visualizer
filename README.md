* Adjustable array size and sorting speed
* Supports the following algorithms:

  * Bubble Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Heap Sort
* Displays time and space complexity for each algorithm
* Code snippet display for each algorithm

## 📈 Time and Space Complexities

Example: Bubble Sort

* Worst-case Time: **O(N²)**
* Average-case Time: **Θ(N²)**
* Best-case Time: **Ω(N)**
* Space Complexity: **O(1)**

(Similar info is displayed for each sorting algorithm in the interface.)
